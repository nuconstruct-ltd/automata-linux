# Kernel Livepatching Guide

Our image supports kernel livepatching via the use of kpatch. 

## General Guidelines on Livepatching

> [!Warning]
> Live-patching is meant to be a stop-gap, not a replacement for a full kernel upgrade. Use it only for urgent, critical fixes when you cannot stop running your CVM right away. Schedule a maintenance window when possible and migrate to a newer disk image that already includes the patched, upgraded kernel.

- The current image uses linux kernel 6.15.2, and was compiled with gcc-12 on Ubuntu 22.04. Please build your patches against this kernel version.

## High-Level Overview of Livepatching Process
1. First, users will use our `cvm-cli` to create a set of asymmetric keys. These asymmetric keys will be placed in the [secure_boot/](../secure_boot/) folder as `secure_boot/livepatch.key` and `secure_boot/livepatch.crt`. This key will be used in Step 3. to sign a livepatch.
2. When users deploy a CVM to a cloud provider using our cli (eg. `./cvm-cli deploy-gcp`), our scripts check whether `secure_boot/livepatch.crt` exists. If it does, it will be included as part of the Secure Boot Signature Database (DB) when the scripts create an image on the cloud provider.
3. Users create a livepatch, and sign it using `./cvm-cli sign-livepatch patch.ko` (assuming the patch module is called patch.ko).
4. Users deploy the livepatch using `./cvm-cli <csp> <vm-name>`. This script is a convenience function that uploads the livepatch into the CVM using the attestation agent API exposed on port 8000 of the VM. When the attestation agent receives the livepatch, it first calls `kpatch unload --all` to remove all older livepatches. Then it calls `kpatch load patch.ko`. The kernel checks whether patch.ko has been signed by a key that has been either built into the kernel, or exists in the Platform Trusted Keyring (Secure Boot Signature DB is part of this keyring). If the signature check passes, the patch will be loaded. Otherwise, it will be rejected, and the API will return an error.

In the following sections, we cover more details on Step 1, Step 3, and Step 4.

## Step 1. Creating Keys to use with your Livepatch

> [!Note]
> This step should be run before deploying your VM onto a cloud provider.

Use our CLI to generate keys that will be used at a later step to sign and verify the livepatches.
```bash
./cvm-cli generate-livepatch-keys
```

## Step 3. Creating a Livepatch

1. Get Linux kernel and required dependencies to build it:

  ```bash
  # Enable deb-src in package list if not enabled yet.
  sudo sed -i 's/^# deb-src/deb-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list
  sudo apt update

  # Get Kernel deps
  sudo apt build-dep linux
  sudo apt install \
    bc gawk flex bison openssl libssl-dev \
    libelf-dev libncurses-dev dkms dwarves \
    libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf llvm gcc-12
  
  # Set gcc-12 as the default gcc
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-12 120

  # Clone Linux Kernel
  git clone --branch v6.15.2 --depth 1 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
  ```

> [!Note]
> You should make a copy of this linux kernel source in order to make your patches, as kpatch-build (in the steps below) requires the original un-modified source and the patch diffs.

1. Please check out the detailed [Patch Author Guide](https://github.com/dynup/kpatch/blob/master/doc/patch-author-guide.md) for details on how to format your livepatch. In general:
  - You should only patch code, not data structures.
  - Please make your patches cumulative. For simplicity, our cvm-image only supports full-replacement patches (ie, patches built with `REPLACE=1`, which is the default setting used by kpatch-build), so only one patch can be active at a time. 
  - To give a concrete example: Suppose this is your first patch, `patch1.patch`, built into `patch1.ko` and installed into the CVM:
    ```bash
    diff --git a/fs/proc/meminfo.c b/fs/proc/meminfo.c
    index 83be312159c9..95279525777e 100644

            si_meminfo(&i);
            si_swapinfo(&i);
            committed = vm_memory_committed();

    ```

    Later, you need to add another patch. The second patch, `patch2.patch` should look like this:
    ```bash
    diff --git a/fs/proc/meminfo.c b/fs/proc/meminfo.c
    index 83be312159c9..95279525777e 100644

            return true;

    ```

    As you can see in the above example, `patch2.patch` is a superset of `patch1.patch`. This is because when loading `patch2.ko` (generated from `patch2.patch`),
    `patch1.ko` will be unloaded and only `patch2.ko` will be active.
    
    Whenever you need to generate a new patch, the new patch should be a superset of all the applied older patches.


2. Clone and build kpatch:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dynup/kpatch
  cd kpatch && make all
  sudo make install
  ```


3. Build the livepatch. Our linux kernel config can be found [here](config).
  ```bash
  kpatch-build -s path/to/linux-kernel-src -c path/to/linux-kernel-config -j10 -o patch-output-folder/ your-patch.patch
  ```
  - `-s`: This is the path to the original **unmodified** linux kernel source code
  - `-c`: This is the path to the linux kernel config, you can use our [config](config).
  - `-o`: The output folder where the built `livepatch-XXXX.ko` will be stored.

  After the build is done, you should see a `livepatch-XXXX.ko` inside the `patch-output-folder/`. kpatch-build will only output one module that contains all the patched functions from across different components in the kernel.

4. Sign the livepatch:

  ```bash
  ./cvm-cli sign-livepatch /path/to/livepatch.ko
  ```

## Step 4: Deploy the Livepatch
Use our CLI tool to deploy the livepatch to your CVM:
```bash
# ./cvm-cli livepatch <cloud-provider> <vm-name> <path-to-livepatch>
# <cloud-provider> = "aws" or "gcp" or "azure"
./cvm-cli livepatch gcp my-cvm-name /path/to/livepatch.ko
```
